"Agricultural research increasingly seeks to quantify complex interactions of processes for a wide range of environmental conditions and crop management scenarios. This often requires combining multiple sets of experimental data and using tools such as simulation, regression and artificial intelligence. Standardizing data formats for documenting experiments facilitate exchanges of information and software, allowing researchers to focus on research per se rather than on converting and re-formatting data or trying to estimate or otherwise compensate for missing information. The ICASA standards were developed to provide a robust set of terminology that is organized according to groups and subgroups that correspond to information groupings commonly encountered in field experiments (Hunt et al., 2001; White et al., 2013)."
"The ICASA Data Dictionary contains the current set of ICASA terms with associated variable names, definitions, units of measurement, and other information. This includes the column ‘Code_synon’ which gives equivalent variable names as used in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). Further information on the column headings are given in the worksheet ‘Explanatory_notes’."
"This version of the Dictionary was migrated from a version maintained as a Google Sheet. We strive for backward compatibility but in the process of correcting inconsistencies in naming and removing obsolete information, problems may be encountered. To ensure compatibility with existing software, the previous version is still accessible at http://www.tinyurl.com/icasa-mvl."
"Users having questions, comments or suggestions for new terms can consult the Github site, https://github.com/DSSAT/ICASA-Dictionary, or the “Contact us” portal at DSSAT.net (https://dssat.net/contact-us/). Please note that ICASA depends mainly on volunteer labor and lacks core funding that might allow development of new features."
